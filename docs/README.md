# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview of Project Management Processes

OctoAcme’s project management processes are designed to promote clarity, collaboration, and continuous delivery across teams. Projects begin with a focused Initiation phase, where business needs are validated, outcomes are clarified, and stakeholder alignment is secured through deliverables like a one-pager, risk list, and communication plan. Once approved, initiatives move into the Planning phase; here, actionable backlogs are created, risks and dependencies are identified, responsibilities are assigned, and milestones are mapped out.

Core teams operate with clearly defined roles: Project Managers handle delivery coordination, risk management, and communication; Product Managers shepherd product vision and outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure success; Developers are responsible for implementing and testing features according to defined acceptance criteria; QA specialists ensure releases meet the quality bar; and Stakeholders provide approval and feedback. These personas interact through established rhythms including daily standups, weekly syncs, demo/review sessions, and regular retrospectives—enabling progress updates, risk surfacing, and ongoing alignment.

Quality assurance underpins all stages, with mandatory automated and manual testing (unit, integration, end-to-end), code reviews, and security scans before deployment. CI/CD pipelines enforce standards and enable repeatable and safe releases. Releases follow a documented process with checklists, release notes, and rollback/incident playbooks to minimize disruptions and support fast recovery. Metrics such as velocity, burndown, and key product signals are tracked and reported for transparency.

Communication is structured to ensure clarity and responsiveness. Weekly and monthly updates, as well as incident and escalation paths, keep teams and stakeholders informed. Risks are proactively managed via a register that is reviewed and updated at set intervals. Retrospectives and continuous improvement practices help teams capture learnings and refine the process over time—promoting a culture of psychological safety and iterative enhancement. This documentation offers a living, centralized source of truth for all project management practices at OctoAcme, enabling effective onboarding and consistent execution.
